_Task: https:/some/url/{insert-URL}_

**Purpose**

_e.g. To make it easier to write PRs and to provide more details for the reviewer._

_Example Questions:_
- _What user story is being implemented or what problem is being solved?_
- _What value is this change providing?_
- _Why is this change being made or feature being added?_

**Changes**

_e.g._
- _Add an optional Jira task link above_
- _Add headings for different sections of this PR_
- _Add optional headings to provide more information_

_e.g. Add a pull request template for our `imply-cloud` so future pull requests will use this template._

_Example Questions:_
- _How was the solution or feature implemented?_
- _What new classes, files, or modules were created or modified to implement the story?_

**Context (Optional)**

_e.g. As requested from one our retrospectives, we want to have more descriptive PRs.
Having a good template would encourage us, I hope, to not leave an empty description.
One-liner descriptions would be okay I suppose..._

**Testing Notes (Optional)**

_e.g. To run all the unit tests do `make unit` or to run this specific test, do `make ...`_

_e.g. To run a manual test do:_
- _Check whether someone has read this document_
- _Make sure they've understood all the components of this document_
- _Double make sure they've read everything up until this line_
